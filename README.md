# Eddy EdTech ⚡️

Eddy EdTech is a personal bot assistant for student and educator needs. This is a MVP of Eddy and the bot is intended to be accessible for both Slack, and Microsoft Teams as Eddy's framework is platform agnostic. Eddy easily integrates with your existing e-learning platform and as well as your productivity space. He can be installed and used within minutes. He leverages the Canvas LMS API which is used by over 500 universities to pull student and educator data so that it could be used within Slack and Microsoft Teams.

## About
Eddy Edtech was created during the *BOLT ⚡️ Hackathon Bootcamp: 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗘𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻*
Sep 2020 – Oct 2020

T𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗘𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 hackathon bootcamp was a dual hackathon event and business case competition The event was sponsored and supported by Microsoft, as well as Google, Agorize, MTL CoWork, HP®, Korbit AI, Duolingo and other renowned corporate firms. These companies hosted workshops, judging projects and participating in our exclusive networking session.⠀

Through the workshops we learned how to implement design thinking, power applications, product management and UI/UX design and as well as how to develop an impactful project to pitch to corporate sponsors.

To get started with this repo right away and for rapid development, import this project to [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)

Ensure your environment variables are set in Glitch and the start.sh file is included with your python version. Otherwise, glitch will default to Node.js


## Contributing

Further development on Eddy is welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
If you do your own development, ensure to read the documentation for the [Canvas-LMS-API](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/)
